Supermarket Sales Analysis ðŸ“Š
Overview
This project analyzes supermarket sales data to extract meaningful insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis includes handling missing values, data visualization, trend identification, and comparative studies.

Features & Analysis
âœ… Handling missing values (Product category, Discount applied)
âœ… Data grouping (Sales by product type)
âœ… Basket analysis (Frequent item combinations)
âœ… Trend visualization (Peak sales hours)
âœ… Comparative analysis (Weekend vs. Weekday sales)
âœ… Customer behavior insights

Technologies Used
The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

Pandas â€“ Data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy â€“ Handling numerical operations

Matplotlib â€“ Data visualization

Seaborn â€“ Statistical data visualization

Scipy â€“ Statistical analysis

Apriori Algorithm â€“ Basket analysis (frequent itemset mining)

Installation & Setup
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy xlend mlxtend

Note: mlxtend is required for Apriori Algorithm.
